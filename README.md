## Features

### Shuffling 

In shuffle mode the song queue is randomly ordered. 
Any new albums or playlists added will be shuffled and appended to the queue.

### Repeat Mode 

There are three states: `Off`, `All`, and `Track`. 
`Off` will stop repeating after the current queue is finished. 
`All` will repeat the entire queue when the last song is reached. 
`Track` will repeat the current song forever.

### Queue Management

Songs can be added to the queue by selecting albums and playlists in the respective tabs. 
Shift clicking appends. 
Regular clicking replaces.

## File Formatting

Koji requires the following file formats for songs and playlists:

### Albums

Albums should be stored in the following directory structure: `~/.config/koji/albums/<artist>/<album>/<title>.<ext>`. As an example: `~/.config/koji/albums/Grimes/Visions/Infinite Love without Fulfilment.mp3`  

**Optional Metadata:**

For each song file in the album to sort and display them appropriately they should have the following ID3 metadata tags:

- **track**: The tracks number.
- **title**: The songs title.
- **artist**: The artists name.

### Playlists

Playlists should be stored as `.m3u` files in the directory structure: `~/.config/koji/playlists/<playlist-name>/<playlist-title>.m3u`

Each line in the playlist file should contain the path to a song ideally in the directory `~/.config/koji/playlists/<playlist-name>/` with the following format of: `<title>.<ext>`
Otherwise you can use direct paths to files in albums or elsewhere.

For each song file in the playlist to display them appropriately they should have the following ID3 metadata tags:

- **title**: The songs title.
- **album**: The albums name.
- **artist**: The artists name.
